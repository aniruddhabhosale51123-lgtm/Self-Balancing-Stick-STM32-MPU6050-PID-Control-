# Self-Balancing-Stick-STM32-MPU6050-PID-Control-
A real-time self-balancing system using STM32F103 (Blue Pill), MPU6050 IMU, and a fully tuned PID controller. The project reads accelerometer + gyroscope values, applies a complementary filter, computes tilt angle, and drives a DC motor via PWM to keep the stick balanced.
